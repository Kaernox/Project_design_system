    Here we have our akk-loading, the property loading is binded with the checkbox so you can test this directive by indicating wether there is loading or not. To use it in your project, simply add the akk-loading directive as an attribute to any html element that you want to add a loading status to, and then assign a value to loading attribute, that value should be true when your content is loading and then changed to false when you content has finished loading
